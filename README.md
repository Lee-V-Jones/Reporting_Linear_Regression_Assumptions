# Reporting_Linear_Regression_Assumptions

This research project is part of a PhD by Lee Jones and examines statistical quality in health and biomedical research by focusing on linear regression models. This repository has all the materials required to create the manuscript “Common misconceptions held by health researchers when interpreting linear regression assumptions, a cross-sectional study” by Lee Jones, Adrian Barnett, and Dimitrios Vagenas. 

This publication was created using R Quarto. To run it, you will need installations of R, RStudio, Quarto, and a LaTeX distribution such as TeX Live.  All data and figures used in the manuscript can be found in the respective folders.  Session information about the version of R packages used to reproduce this manuscript is also included.
